# DISCO Astronomy 🛸

> **⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS (WIP)**
> This software is currently in early active development. Features and documentation are being updated frequently.

**DISCO** (**D**eprojection **I**mage **S**oftware for **C**ircumstellar **O**bjects) is a specialized tool designed for the interactive analysis of astronomical FITS data, specifically focused on protoplanetary disks.

It bridges the gap between scientific Python libraries and modern web interfaces, providing a fluid experience for data visualization, deprojection, and radial profile extraction.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Python 3.10+ (FastAPI, Astropy, Scipy, Numpy).
* **Frontend:** JavaScript (React, Vite, BlueprintJS).
* **Distribution:** PyPI (Python Package Index).

## Quick Start

DISCO is available on PyPI and can be installed via pip on any system (Linux, Mac, Windows):

```bash
# 1. Install
pip install disco-astronomy

# 2. Run
disco-start
```
